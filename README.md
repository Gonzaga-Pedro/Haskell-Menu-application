# Haskell-IO-Applications
This repository harbours a code in Haskell using the concepts of IO.

## The code
The code seeks to show the possibility of using IO in Haskell programming. Basically the code runs on a series of recursive functions that runs a menu.
This menu simulates a library, in which the user can insert books into a Database, remove from the Database and search a book in the Database by inserting one parameter (Name, Author, Year of release).
